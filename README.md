# Deadball
To play the release, download the deadball.zip from the latest release and open the deadball script from the bin folder. Thanks!

Contact I-UN-H on discord, you should know who that is, if you have any issues or bugs, this is currently a playtest to make sure things are working!

Known Issues/Things to change
1. Need multiple enters to continue to the next at-bat
2. Seperate at-bat outputs to allow a more "suspensful" watch
