# Deadball
Download https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk24-windows this one... specifically
To play the release, download the deadball.zip from the latest release and open the deadball script from the bin folder. Thanks!

Contact I-UN-H on discord, you should know who that is, if you have any issues or bugs (send a screenshot of the issue if you can... or copy and paste the entire output and put it in a .txt file) , this is currently a playtest to make sure things are working!

Known Issues/Things to change
1. Need multiple enters to continue to the next at-bat
2. Seperate at-bat outputs to allow a more "suspensful" watch
3. Change some text to be either more descriptive/simplified

What's missing?
1. Oddities
2. Pitchers (primary focus)!
3. A easier way to create new traits (possibly just its own object class, have a method that can be used when it applies in the game)
4. Save states, possibly in .txt files idk yet gotta figure that out
5. Manager choices!
6. Very very late in dev, automated managers, in take the info of a game including inning, scores, current batter, runners, batter/pitcher handedness, that jazz

That should be all for rn, enjoy :)
